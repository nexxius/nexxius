# Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹
I'm a technology lawyer, cybersecurity connoisseur, and IT geek.

## Background and Experience :mortar_board:
My professional work primarily focuses on drafting and negotiating commercial technology contracts, such as software licenses, SaaS agreements, and software development agreements. I'm particularly interested in open source software licensing. 

Cybersecurity underpins both my professional experience and my personal projects. I have obtained the CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA CySA+ certifications. I'm currently working towards Server+ and PenTest+. 

## Current Projects :computer:
Some of the projects I'm currently working on include:
- Home automation with Home Assistant running in Docker on a Raspberry Pi 4.
- Data Monitoring and visualization using Grafana and InfluxDB in Docker on a Raspberry Pi 4.
- Creating scripts to quickly deploy virtual machines.
- Setting up, maintaining, using, and improving my Homelab, which is running:
  - a custom-built pfsense box;
  - a Raspberry Pi 4 as an always-on server providing various services;
  - a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a fail-over server for the Raspberry Pi 4;
  - a Synology DS920+ as a NAS and media server;
